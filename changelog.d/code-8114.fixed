Pro Engine now more accurately tracks the scope of Python local variables. For
example, the following code defines two `z` variables that should be tracked
separately.

```
z = 1

def foo():
    z = 2
    a = z
```

The Pro engine now correctly recognizes that the `z` assigned to `a` is the one
defined in the local scope, not the global scope.
