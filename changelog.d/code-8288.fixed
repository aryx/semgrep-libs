taint-mode: Fixed bug in taint "auto-cleaning" where we automatically clean the
LHS of an assigmnet if the RHS is clean, provided that the LHS is not subject to
any "side-effects". In some cases, this could cause the taint analysis to timeout.
Some combinations of rules and repos will see a major perf improvement, in other
cases it may not be noticeable.
