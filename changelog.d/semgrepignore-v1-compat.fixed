The behavior of `--semgrepignore-v2` changed to be closer to the legacy
Semgrepignore v1. `.gitignore` files are no longer loaded automatically
as part of the Semgrepignore v2 exclusion mechanism.
Loading a `.gitignore` file must be done
by placing `:include .gitignore` in the `.semgrepignore` file
as was the case with Semgrepignore v1.
