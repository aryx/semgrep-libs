tainting: Apply `taint_assume_safe_numbers` and `taint_assume_safe_booleans`
earlier when considering to track taint through class fields and function
parameters. If the field/parameter has a number/Boolean type and the
corresponding option is set, it will just not be tracked. In some cases this
can help with performance.

Also added `short`/`Short` to the list of integer types recognized by
`taint_assume_safe_numbers`.
