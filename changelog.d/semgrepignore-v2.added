The `--semgrepignore-v2` option is now the default for users of Semgrep
Community Edition. This brings the behavior of the Semgrepignore file
exclusions closer to Git and `.gitignore` files. There can now
be multiple `.semgrepignore` files in the project. The `.semgrepignore` file
in the current folder is no longer consulted unless it in the project.
Negated patterns are now supported such as `!scanme.py` as with Gitignore.
Some bugs were fixed.
