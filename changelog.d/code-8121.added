Pro: new `metavariable-name` operator which allows for expressing a constraint
against the fully qualified name or nearest equivalent of a metavariable
(useful mainly in JavaScript and TypeScript, where there is no first-class
syntax for this, or where such names or pseudo-names containt symbols which
cannot appear in identifiers). Requires pro naming passes and works best with
interfile naming.

Additional documentation forthcoming.
